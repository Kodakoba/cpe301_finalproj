CPE Final project (group 25):
By Lloyd Cargo and Bailey Escritor
----------------------------------
contains lots of code, most of it a weird approach. 
finalprojectB is the actual functioning project, and the main folder is a more oop take on it initially.

some learning words of wisdom;
>the arduino compiler needs a PR for an issue we encountered regarding conditional logic, however it is unlikely I will be able to simply because gcc is /that/ far gone in terms of codebase.
>header files are you friend after you got it working. Due to time constraints near the end we couldn't possibly refactor and organize it more efficiently as we had wanted to (even if most of it was just all the headers put into a mono file set.)
>offsets are your friend.
>the dht11 needs a better library, there's no better way to put it. it's a large library we used and it isn't fun to work with particularly.

keep moving forward, maybe in the future this project could be more effectively tackled with an RP20 based controller (like the pi pico 2)
